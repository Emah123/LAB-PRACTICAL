        <li><b>Objective:</b> To create a simple login page using html. </li>
        <li><p><b>Theory:</b> The &lt;form&gt; element is used to create the form, and the action attribute which
             tells the browser where to send the form data when the user submits it. The method
              attribute is set to “post” which tells the browser to send the data in the body of the HTTP
               request.<br>
<p>The &lt;label&gt; element is used to create a text label for the input fields, and the for attribute
     is used to associate the label with the  corresponding input field. The &lt;input&gt; elements are
      used to create the text fields for the username and password. The type attribute is set to
       “text” for the username field and “password” for the password field, which tells the
        browser to mask the characters entered in the password field.<br>
The required attribute is added to the input fields, which tells the browser that these fields
 must be field out before the form can be submitted.<br>
The &lt;input type=”submit” &gt; element is used to create a submit button, and the value
 attribute is set to “Login” which will be displayed on the button.<br>
There are several others input such as radio and checkboxes</p></li>
